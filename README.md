# Sorting Visualizer
Visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library.
Visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with the SDL2 Library. A sorting algorithm arranges the elements of a list in a certain order. While many sorting algorithms exist, a few predominate in practical implementations. In this sorting visualizer, we will look at some of these algorithms and visually comprehend their workings.
The sorting algorithms covered here are:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

# How to run:-
 You can also run Sorting Visualizer using the C++ source code available in the repository i.e., Sorting Visualizer.cpp but you will need to install and setup the SDL2 library first. I recommend you follow Lazy Foo' Productions' tutorial to setup SDL2 Library. Just use x86_64-w64-mingw32 folder instead of i686-w64-mingw32 to setup the SDL2 files.-> [How to download and setup SDL2 library]( https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/index.php).
After setting up the SDL2 library, just include the Sorting Visualizer.cpp file from the repository in your project with the build options as mentioned in the tutorial and build and run the project.
# Controls:-

WARNING: Giving repetitive commands may cause latency and the visualizer may behave unexpectedly. Please give a new command only after the current command's execution is done.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
